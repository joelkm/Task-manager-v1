PLEASE, be patient, I'm using render's free tier for deployment, so the first API calls tend to go slow (reeeeeally slow). The first web load and some UI refreshes will take a bit. Sorry for the inconvenience üôè

## Frontend:

React multi-page app. I started working with ejs, then moved to React. The different views are displayed using React-router. There are 2 additional views for account recovery that I plan to work on (v2).

## Backend:

Express + MongoDB API that handles both auth and tasks.

I'm using express session + passport.js to handle session logic. The database is live at Atlas (MongoDB cloud) and the service layer interacts with it using Mongoose.
